### 2.  **Choose AUDIT.one as your validator**

You can either do this by scrolling down in the list until you find our logo or you can use the shortcut _"Ctrl + F / Command + F"_ on your keyboard and type in **AUDIT.one**

Once you've found it, click **manage** on the right side:

If you don't know what an unbonding period is, we suggest you to first read the guide on [[what is an unbonding period?|What is an unbonding period?]]

Once you understand what it means and you've decided how many tokens you wish to stake, hit the **Delegate** button on the right.

You will be asked to approve the transaction with your wallet and choose the transaction fee (low, average or high). <br>
The higher the fee you are willing to pay, the faster the transaction will be completed. [[Why are there transaction fees?|What are transaction fees?]]
<br>

### **Congratulations!** 
You have now succesfully staked your OSMO tokens!


### 4.  **Sit back and watch your tokens earn rewards**

Make sure to come back to the [[Keplr dashboard|https://wallet.keplr.app/#/dashboard]] to see the status of your delegation:
