In most cryptocurrencies and in fiat currencies like US dollars or euros, each unit is intended to be equivalent to and interchangeable with every other unit. This property is called fungibility.

A non-fungible token, or NFT, is a type of digital asset in which each unit differs from other units. In other words, each NFT is unique.

[CryptoKitties](https://www.cryptokitties.co/) are one of the most well-known examples of NFTs.
