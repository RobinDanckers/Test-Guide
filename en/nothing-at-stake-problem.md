The nothing at stake problem refers to the potential for block producers in **Proof of Stake** networks to sign or approve multiple blocks within a single chain or multiple chains without any consequence. In contrast to **Proof of Work** blockchains, the cost of working on multiple chains in a PoS network is trivial. This could lead to difficulty achieving consensus or reduced security.
