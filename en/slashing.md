# Slashing

Validators in Proof of Stake networks who make mistakes or engage in malicious behavior can be subject to fines. Slashing occurs when a validator commits a serious offense and results in large penalties. Slashing is one of the mechanisms that disincentivizes attempts by validators to break the rules of the protocol.
