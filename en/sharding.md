# Sharding

Sharding is an approach to scaling in which a blockchain’s state is partitioned into individual pieces called shards, each of which contains a fragment of the network’s total state and transaction history. This allows nodes to process transactions for a subset of shards rather than for the entire network increasing transaction throughput.
