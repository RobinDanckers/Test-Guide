# Consensus mechanism

A consensus mechanism (or consensus algorithm) is a mechanism used in blockchains to achieve consensus about the state of the blockchain. In other words, consensus mechanisms ensure that all participants in a decentralized network are synchronized and agree on the history of transactions in the network.

Proof of Stake and Proof of Work are currently the two most common consensus mechanisms.
