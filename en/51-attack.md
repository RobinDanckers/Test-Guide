In a Proof of Work blockchain, a 51% attack occurs when a participant attempts to take control of a network by controlling 51% of the hashrate in the case of a **Proof of Work** coin, or 51% of the total number of coins in a **Proof of Stake** system. A successful 51% attack can enable the attacker to revert transactions or **double spend** coins.
