# Proof of Stake

Proof of Stake is a consensus mechanism in which “validators” propose and verify blocks in a blockchain network. These validators are required to lock up or "stake" a certain amount of the network's native cryptocurrency and are kept honest by the ever-present possibility that their stake will be deducted or “slashed” if they engage in malicious behavior.
