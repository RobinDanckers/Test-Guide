# Glossary

The blockchain world is evolving at a frenetic pace, and it can be hard to keep up. If youâ€™re new to the space, we hope you can turn to this glossary of terms as you build up your knowledge of this rapidly evolving field.

## Contributing

Proposals to adding new terms, and editing or translating existing contents are always welcome! Feel free to create issues or pull requests.

### Contribution guidelines

Currently, we welcome three types of contributions, including:

1. **Edit**: Making changes to an existing term.
2. **Addition**: Adding a new term to the glossary.
3. **Translation**: Translating an existing term into different languages.

The purpose of a new issue, branch, or pull request should always fit one of the types. We also recommend using the according type as a keyword in the issue, branch, or pull request name respectively as follows:

1. **Issue**:
	- Format: `[[type]] short description`
	- Example: `[translation] Mandarin (zh) version of 51-attack`

2. **Branch**:
	- Format: `[type]/short-description-in-kebab-case`
	- Example: `translation/add-mandarin-version-of-51-attack`

3. **Pull Request (PR)**:
	- Format: `[[type]] short description`
	- Example: `[translation] Add Mandarin version of 51-attack`

### Review and publish

Once a pull request is created, we will review the changes as soon as possible. Our team will decide if the changes are good to be included, or discuss further revisions required under the pull request's discussion thread. If everything is approved, the change will be merged into the glossary, and deployed at [stake.fish/glossary](stake.fish/glossary/).
